# Portfolio---Guess-My-Number
This is a simple project demonstrating skills with HTML, CSS flexbox, front-end JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.

The project is a game that has the user guessing a number between 1 and 20. The game will guide the user based on whether their guess is valid, too high, or too low.
When the user guesses the correct number, a new highscore will be set, if the current highscore has not been set or is lower.
